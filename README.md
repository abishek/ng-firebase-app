# The Joke Project

A simple project with the sole purpose of learning firebase as a quick platform to try out ideas.

## What does it do?

The Joke Project will collect text jokes and memes from across the internet. No, not automatically. We can add them as we go. In the first version, it just collects the stuff. In the next update, it will attach a joke to the user that added it. Eventually, it will have support for tags/genres/stars, track most viewed, popular, ability to share outside the platform among others. The repo will remain public and is built as a web-app.
